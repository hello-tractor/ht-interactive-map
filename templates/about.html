                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>The "Interactive Agricultural Map for Hello Tractor Users" project is designed to display essential agricultural data for various regions within Kenya through an interactive map.</p>
                
                <p>This map is aimed at enhancing the experience and productivity of Hello Tractor users, including farmers, tractor owners, booking agents, and other stakeholders. By leveraging critical data such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and rainfall patterns, the map will facilitate better decision-making and resource allocation, ultimately leading to improved agricultural outcomes.</p>
                
                <h2>Benefits for Stakeholders</h2>
                <p>Hello Tractor users stand to gain significantly from this project. For tractor owners and service providers, real-time NDVI data will enable optimized service delivery by highlighting areas with healthy vegetation where tractor services are most needed, such as for plowing and planting.</p>
                
                <p>This efficient resource allocation will help maximize productivity and reduce downtime. Farmers will benefit from improved crop management as NDVI data can identify stressed areas, guiding adjustments in irrigation and fertilizer application, which in turn can lead to higher yields and increased income.</p>
                
                <p>Additionally, access to rainfall and precipitation data allows farmers to plan planting and harvesting more effectively and to take timely actions in response to potential droughts or excessive rainfall, thereby mitigating risks and reducing the likelihood of crop failure.</p>
